        Product designing involves imaginating, creating and iterating product that solves users problems and addresing
        specific needs in a given market
    </p>
    <p>
        Product designers are basically problem solvers, they asses prospective customers habits, behaviours,
        frustrations, wants and needs and find ways to provide solutions for these problems. As a product designer,
        you're meant to be empathetic, understand users, their needs, analyze solutions, provide solutons and test them
        with real life users.
